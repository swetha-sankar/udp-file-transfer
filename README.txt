CISC 450: Programming Assigment #2
README.txt: Describes relevant files and includes compilation instructions

**List of Relevant Files**:

out.txt: Textfile generated by client upon running program 

imports.h: Contains all necessary includes for both the client and the server. It defines constants and the packet node type. 

printError.c: Contains a short function that prints a message to perror and exits out of the program. The error(*errorMsg) function is used frequently within both the client and the server to check for issues with socket creation and communication.

udpcli.c: Main file for the UDP client. Contains all driver code for the client (includes SimulateACKLoss)

udpserv.c: Main file for the UDP server. Contains all driver code for the server (includes SimulateLoss).


**Compilation & Running Instructions**:
I used a Linux environment to create this program (UDEL server). The port number 8080 and the IP address 127.0.0.1 are hardcoded. 
Please enter the name of the file as a path to the file (ex. /usa/swetha/hello.txt)

Using Included Makefile:
The makefile will create two executables: server and client. They take the parameters specified in the instructions
as command line arguments.
> make
> ./server [timeout] [packet loss ratio]
> ./client [filename] [ACK loss ratio]


Without Using Makefile:
Begin by compiling the server with gcc -o server udpserv.c -lm and compiling the client with 
gcc -o client udpcli.c.
The -lm links it with the math library (necessary for the pow function). 
Please run ./server [timeout] [packet loss ratio] before running ./client [filename] [ACK loss ratio]. 

SERVER: gcc -o server udpserv.c -lm
        ./server [timeout] [packet loss ratio]

CLIENT: gcc -o client udpcli.c 
        ./client [filename] [ACK loss ratio]
